# Exercise Snippets

A haphazard selection of my responses to various coding challenges I've run into. Some are things friends told me they got asked in a job interview and I had to go home and try them out myself, while others are variations on things I did at Meetups.

I have deliberately not looked for sample problems on the Internet, nor have I looked anywhere for solutions. This is more of a repository of things I just happened upon.
