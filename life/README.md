# Life

This is an implementation of [Life, by mathematician John Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

A little while ago I went to an all-day Meetup to learn a bit of Coffeescript. We spent the day in 45-minute pair programming sessions in which we tried to implement the Game of Life, then erased the code at the end of 45 minutes and paired up with someone else and tried it again. It was a fun exercise. And Coffeescript is interesting. But when I got home I did it in Javascript, which I'm much more comfortable with. So here it is.

As time goes on I will add more user-interface features, like a way for the user to set more initial conditions, and a start/stop toggle button and a reset button.

Perhaps even a way to set each square on the grid before it begins running, by clicking the mouse to make each square black. Yeah, now we're talking.
